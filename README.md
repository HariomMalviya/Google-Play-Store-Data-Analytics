Tasks Discriptions-

1. Visualize the sentiment distribution (positive, neutral, negative) of user reviews using a stacked bar chart, segmented by rating groups (e.g., 1-2 stars, 3-4 stars, 4-5 stars). Include only apps with more than 1,000 reviews and group by the top 5 categories.

2. Generate a word cloud for the most frequent keywords found in 5-star reviews, but exclude common stopwords and app names. Additionally, filter the reviews to include only those from apps in the "Health & Fitness" category.

3. Create an interactive Choropleth map using Plotly to visualize global installs by Category. Apply filters to show data for only the top 5 app categories and highlight category where the number of installs exceeds 1 million. The app category should not start with the characters “A,” “C,” “G,” or “S.” This graph should work only between 6 PM IST and 8 PM IST; apart from that time, we should not show it in the dashboard itself.

4. Create a dual-axis chart comparing the average installs and revenue for free vs. paid apps within the top 3 app categories. Apply filters to exclude apps with fewer than 10,000 installs and revenue below $10,000 and android version should be more than 4.0 as well as size should be more than 15M and content rating should be Everyone and app name should not have more than 30 characters including space and special character .this graph should work only between 1 PM IST to 2 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.

5. Use a grouped bar chart to compare the average rating and total review count for the top 10 app categories by number of installs. Filter out any categories where the average rating is below 4.0 and size below 10 M and last update should be Jan month . this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.

6. Generate a heatmap to show the correlation matrix between installs, ratings, and review counts. Filter the data to include only apps that have been updated within the last year and have at least 100,000 installs and reviews count should be more than 1k and genres name should not be Starting with characters A , F , E , G , I , K . this graph should work only between 2 PM IST to 4 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.

7. Plot a time series line chart to show the trend of total installs over time, segmented by app category. Highlight periods of significant growth by shading the areas under the curve where the increase in installs exceeds 20% month-over-month and content rating should be teen and app name should start with letter ‘E’ and installs should be more than 10k as well as this graph should work only between 6 PM IST to 9 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.

8. Plot a bubble chart to analyze the relationship between app size (in MB) and average rating, with the bubble size representing the number of installs. Include a filter to show only apps with a rating higher than 3.5 and that belong to the "Games" category and installs should be more than 50k as well as this graph should work only between 5 PM IST to 7 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.

9. Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of ratings for each app category, but only include categories with more than 50 apps and app name should contain letter “C” and exclude apps with fewer than 10 reviews and rating should be less 4.0. this graph should work only between 4 PM IST to 6 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.
